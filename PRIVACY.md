# Privacy Policy

## 1. Data Collection & Storage

**GBF Battle Analyzer** ("the Extension") is designed with privacy as a core principle.

- **Local Storage Only**: All game data captured by the Extension is stored locally within your browser using IndexedDB.
- **No External Servers**: We do not operate any servers to collect your data. Your battle logs never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to export or share them.
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other personally identifiable information.

## 2. Game Data Usage

 The Extension captures game battle data (logs, damage numbers, character statuses) solely for the purpose of:
- Displaying battle history and statistics to you.
- Generating visualizations within the Extension's interface.

## 3. Data Export & Sharing

You may choose to use the "Share" feature to generate a shareable file of a specific battle log.

- **Anonymization**: User-specific information is automatically masked during the export process.
- **User Control**: Sharing is a manual action initiated by you. The generated file is saved to your local device, and you decide where and how to share it.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this repository.
